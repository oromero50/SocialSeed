# SocialSeed v2.0 - Memory & Context Preservation System

## 🧠 Overview

This system ensures complete context preservation between development sessions, eliminating the need for repeated briefings and maintaining continuity across all work on SocialSeed.

## 📚 Memory Architecture

### 1. **Document-Based Memory System**

#### Primary Memory Documents
- **`PRD.md`** - Product Requirements & Features (Never changes unless product pivots)
- **`planning.md`** - Technical Architecture & Implementation Strategy  
- **`tasks.md`** - Current Progress, Priorities, and Task Management
- **`TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md`** - Complete system interactions and flows
- **`logs/deployment_progress.md`** - Real-time development status and issues

#### Secondary Memory Documents  
- **`README.md`** - Project overview and quick start
- **`COMPLETE_SETUP_GUIDE.md`** - Deployment procedures
- **`IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`** - Implementation history

### 2. **Context Preservation Protocol**

#### Before Starting Any Development Work
```markdown
1. READ: PRD.md for requirements and success criteria
2. READ: planning.md for architecture and technical details  
3. READ: tasks.md for current priorities and progress
4. READ: TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md for system interactions
5. CHECK: logs/deployment_progress.md for any blocking issues
```

#### During Development Work
```markdown
1. UPDATE: tasks.md with real-time progress
2. LOG: All significant changes in deployment_progress.md
3. DOCUMENT: Any new patterns or decisions
4. TRACK: Issues and resolutions as they occur
```

#### After Completing Work
```markdown
1. MARK COMPLETE: Relevant tasks in tasks.md
2. UPDATE: All relevant documents with new information
3. COMMIT: Changes to Git with descriptive messages
4. SUMMARIZE: Key outcomes and next steps
```

## 🔄 Automated Memory Updates

## 🛠️ Memory System Implementation

### Automated Documentation Sync
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/sync_docs.sh
# Automatic documentation synchronization

echo "🔄 Syncing SocialSeed Documentation..."

# Check for uncommitted changes
if [[ $(git status --porcelain) ]]; then
    echo "⚠️  Uncommitted changes detected. Please commit first."
    exit 1
fi

# Update last modified dates
find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i '' "s/Last Updated: .*/Last Updated: $(date '+%B %d, %Y')/g" {} \;

# Validate document consistency
python scripts/validate_docs.py

# Commit documentation updates
git add *.md
git commit -m "📚 Auto-sync: Update documentation timestamps"

echo "✅ Documentation sync complete"
```

### Context Preservation Git Hooks
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
# Ensure context is preserved before commits

echo "🔍 Validating context preservation..."

# Check if tasks.md has been updated recently
if [ $(find tasks.md -mtime +1) ]; then
    echo "⚠️  tasks.md hasn't been updated recently. Please update progress."
    exit 1
fi

# Check if there are TODOs in code without corresponding tasks
if grep -r "TODO\|FIXME" --include="*.py" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" . > /dev/null; then
    echo "⚠️  Found TODOs in code. Please add to tasks.md or resolve."
    exit 1
fi

echo "✅ Context validation passed"
```

## 📊 Memory System Metrics

### Documentation Health Metrics
```python
# scripts/doc_health.py
"""Track documentation health and completeness"""

import os
import re
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class DocumentationHealth:
    def __init__(self):
        self.docs = ['PRD.md', 'planning.md', 'tasks.md', 'TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md']
        
    def check_health(self) -> dict:
        health = {}
        
        for doc in self.docs:
            if os.path.exists(doc):
                health[doc] = {
                    'exists': True,
                    'last_modified': self._get_last_modified(doc),
                    'size': os.path.getsize(doc),
                    'completeness': self._check_completeness(doc),
                    'consistency': self._check_consistency(doc)
                }
            else:
                health[doc] = {'exists': False}
                
        return health
        
    def _get_last_modified(self, filepath: str) -> str:
        mtime = os.path.getmtime(filepath)
        return datetime.fromtimestamp(mtime).isoformat()
        
    def _check_completeness(self, filepath: str) -> float:
        """Check document completeness based on expected sections."""
        with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
            content = f.read()
            
        # Define expected sections per document type
        expected_sections = {
            'PRD.md': ['Executive Summary', 'Product Vision', 'Technical Requirements'],
            'planning.md': ['System Architecture', 'Implementation', 'Database Design'],
            'tasks.md': ['Project Status', 'Active Tasks', 'Progress Metrics'],
            'TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md': ['Architecture Overview', 'Authentication', 'API Integration']
        }
        
        sections = expected_sections.get(os.path.basename(filepath), [])
        found_sections = sum(1 for section in sections if section in content)
        
        return found_sections / len(sections) if sections else 1.0
        
    def _check_consistency(self, filepath: str) -> bool:
        """Basic consistency checks."""
        with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
            content = f.read()
            
        # Check for placeholder text
        placeholders = ['TODO', 'PLACEHOLDER', 'TBD', '[EDIT THIS]']
        has_placeholders = any(placeholder in content for placeholder in placeholders)
        
        return not has_placeholders

# Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    health_checker = DocumentationHealth()
    health = health_checker.check_health()
    
    print("📊 Documentation Health Report")
    print("=" * 50)
    
    for doc, status in health.items():
        if status.get('exists'):
            print(f"\n📄 {doc}")
            print(f"   Last Modified: {status['last_modified']}")
            print(f"   Size: {status['size']} bytes")
            print(f"   Completeness: {status['completeness']:.1%}")
            print(f"   Consistency: {'✅' if status['consistency'] else '❌'}")
        else:
            print(f"\n❌ {doc} - MISSING")
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria for Memory System

### Memory System is Successful When:
1. **Zero Briefing Required**: New development sessions can start immediately
2. **Complete Context**: All decisions, progress, and issues are documented
3. **Consistent Updates**: Documentation stays current with implementation
4. **Easy Navigation**: Any developer can quickly find relevant information
5. **Change Tracking**: All modifications are logged and traceable

### Memory System Maintenance Schedule:
- **Daily**: Update tasks.md and deployment_progress.md
- **Weekly**: Review and update planning.md if architecture changes
- **Monthly**: Full review of PRD.md for product alignment
- **Per Session**: Context validation before and after work
